# CSCI-103-Lab-2
In this lab you will gain experience writing code that uses arithmetic expressions and
calls built-in functions. You will need to both submit your code electronically AND
demo it for a CP/TA.

In calculus, a Taylor series approximates arbitrary functions by polynomials. E.g.,
the function sin(x) can be approximated using the series expansion:
𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝒙) = 𝒙 −(𝒙^3)/3! + (x^5)/5! - (x^7)/7! ...
⋯
Your goal is to write a program which will compute this approximation. It should
take a decimal number x as input, compute the approximation given by the first
four terms of the above formula, and then print it out. (This formula assumes x is in
radians. Your program should do the same, so no degrees/radians conversion is
necessary.)
Open compute_sin.cpp

In this exercise you will write a program to convert between two color schemes. The  program will convert
from RGB format to CMYK using the following conversion method:
Define 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑒 = max {𝑟𝑒𝑑/255, 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛/255, 𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒/255 }
Your program should take 3 integers, (red, green, and blue) as input from the
keyboard and output the corresponding values for cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black. 
Open color_conv.cpp.
